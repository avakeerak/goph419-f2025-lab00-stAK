# GOPH 419 - Computational Methods for Geophysicists

*Semester:* F2025
*Instructor:* B. Karchewski
*Author:* Ava Keerak

An example repository setup for a simple Python package.\

The functions "add" and "multiply" in the operators.py file and "main" in the driver.py file were included in the manual for Lab 00.\
The functions "divide" and "exponent" in the operators.py file were added by myself.\
The function "polygon_unc" is supposed to give the areal uncertainty for polygons created using GIS tools, and was created by myself based on research by Haritashya et al., 2018, and Krumweide et al., 2014 as well as the Guide to the expression of uncertainty in measurement (Joint Committee for Guides in Metrology, 2008). The math has not yet been peer reviewed and I'm literally an undergrad student so please don't use it for anything important.\
